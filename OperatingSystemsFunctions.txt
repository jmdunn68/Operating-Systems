Memory management is one of the key functions of an operating system.  The main memory of a computer can be accessed from the CPU directly.  It keeps track of the primary memory and allocates memory when a process requests it.  It also de-allocates the memory when the process no longer needs it.
File management is another function of an operating system.  It keeps track of information, uses, location, and even statuses.  It decided who gets the resources, allocates them, and de-allocates them as well.
Device management is another function of an operating system.  The operating system keeps track of all devices.  It also decides whoch process gets the device, allocates the device, and de-allocates the device.
